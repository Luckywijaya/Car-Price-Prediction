# Car-Price-Prediction
Make a regression predictive model to predict the car price.

# Project Overview

• Seek insight from the dataset with Exploratory Data Analysis <br>
• Performed data cleansing, data processing, data engineering to prepare data before modeling<br>
• Built a model to predict whether the car price<br>
<br>
# Exploratory Data Analysis

# **Data Processing**<br>
• Check missing & duplicate values<br>
• Replace all features that have an outliers with IQR limit<br>
• Ordinal encoding for `door` & `cylinder` features<br>
• Feature encoding the rest of categorical columns<br>
• Drop categorical features that encoded before<br>
• Normalize all selected features <br>
<br><br>
# **Modeling**<br>
• Split features & target<br>
• Split data into data train & data test<br>
• Train model with 4 different algorithm such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree<br>
• Evaluate model with MAE Score, RMSE Score & R2 Score<br>
• Validate model with train and test accuracy <br>
• Hyperparameter tuning<br>
• Select the best model<br>
<br><br>
# **Model Evaluation**<br>
